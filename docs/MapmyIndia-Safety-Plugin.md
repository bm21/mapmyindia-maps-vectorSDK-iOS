## [Introduction](#Introduction)

MapmyIndia Safety Plugin will alerts when a user in or near to a
containment zone. If the app is running, a callback method will be
called to get the containment zone information. Safety plugin will push
a local notification when the user goes in or near to the containment
zone, which can be seen from the notification panel.

The library MapmyIndiaSafetyPlugin is part of MapmyIndiaMaps SDK from
version 5.7.5. MapmyIndiaMaps can be installed through Cocoapods by
adding below line in pod file of project:

``` {.cocoapods}
pod 'MapmyIndiaMaps', '~> 5.7.13'
```

**Sample**

A sample to demonstrate features of MapmyIndiaSafetyPlugin can be found
[here](https://github.com/MapmyIndia/mapmyindia-maps-vectorSDK-iOS). Run
pod install or pod update (to update existing pods) command from the
terminal after downloading this sample project.

## [Steps to Integrate SDK in an application](#Steps-to-Integrate-SDK-in-an-application)

## [1. Setup Your Project](#1-Setup-Your-Project)

**Below are additional steps you need to follow when you are integrating
Mapmyindia Safety Plugin in your application.**

1.  Create a new project in Xcode.

2.  Drag and drop the mapmyindiaSafetyPlugin.framework to your project.
    It must be added in embedded binaries.

    **Screenshot:-**

    </div>

3.  Configure the location services by adding the following entries to
    the Info.plist file. locations and motion keys are mandatory.

    -   Location permissions
    -   CoreMotion Permissions

    Above permissions can be added by using below keys in Info.plist of
    an application:

        <key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
        <string>""</string>
        <key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
        <string>""</string>
        <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
        <string>""</string>
        <key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
        <string>""</string>

    **Screenshot:-** ![Project Settings Info Plist
    Permissions](https://s3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/mmi-api-team/moveSDK/GithubDocs/SafetyPlugin/ProjectSettingsInfoPlistPermissions.png)

4.  In your project settings, go to Capabilities &gt; Background Modes
    and turn on background fetch, location updates.

## [2. Initialization](#2-Initialization)

To use features of SDK its initialization is required which can be
achieved by injecting required MapmyIndia Keys. Keys can be obtained
through MapmyIndia's API **Dashboard.**

To initialize SDK code can be written in AppDelegate file which is the
first entry point for an application. So initialize it in
`didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` function of AppDelegate file before
using any feature of MapmyIndiaSafetyPlugin.

To use SDK functionalities you must write import statements as shown
below:

``` {.swift}
import MapmyIndiaSafetyPlugin
import mapmyindiaApikit
```

``` {.swift}
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

    // Below is a line of code for requesting permissions for local notifications.
    MapmyIndiaSafetyPlugin.shared.localNotificationPermission()

    // Below are lines of codes to inject MapmyIndia authorization keys.
    // ignore if you are already added these
    MapmyIndiaAccountManager.setMapSDKKey("")
    MapmyIndiaAccountManager.setRestAPIKey("")
    MapmyIndiaAccountManager.setAtlasClientId("")
    MapmyIndiaAccountManager.setAtlasClientSecret("")
    MapmyIndiaAccountManager.setAtlasGrantType("client_credentials")
    return true
}
```

Below are lines of code to fetch location when an application is in
background.

``` {.swift}
func application(_ application: UIApplication, performFetchWithCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void) {
    MapmyIndiaSafetyPlugin.shared.backgroundfetch(completionHandler: completionHandler)
}
```

To initialize safety plugin call initilize method of
`MapmyIndiaSafetyPlugin` class

``` {.swift}
MapmyIndiaSafetyPlugin.shared.initilize() { (success, onfailError) in  
if success  
{  
// initialization successful

// now you can start plugin  
}  
else{  
// error if any  
}  
}  
```

## [3. Start Plugin](#3-Start-Plugin)

The plugin can start to get an alert when the user goes near or in a
containment zone. We are providing some method and callbacks handler for
getting a response. The plugin will run in the background as well as in
foreground, in the foreground, you will get containment zone info in a
delegate method.

Start safety plugin by calling startSafetyPlugin function of
`MapmyIndiaSafetyPlugin` class

`swift MapmyIndiaSafetyPlugin.shared.startSafetyPlugin()`

## [4. Stop Safety Plugin](#4-Stop-Safety-plugin)

Stop plugin by calling stopSafetyPlugin of `MapmyIndiaSafetyPlugin`
class

`swift MapmyIndiaSafetyPlugin.shared.stopSafetyPlugin()`

## [5. Current Location Safety](#5-Current-Location-Safety)

Call `getCurrentLocationSafety` to check whether it is inside or near to
the containment zone.

`swift MapmyIndiaSafetyPlugin.shared.getCurrentLocationSafety()`

## [6. Enable or Disable Local Notification](#6-Enable-or-Disable-Local-Notification)

Enable/disable local notification by calling following lines of code, we
are showing local notification when user is inside or near containment
zone.

``` {.swift}
MapmyIndiaSafetyPlugin.shared.enableLocalNotification(notificationEnabled: true)
```

## [7. MapmyIndiaSafetyPluginDelegate Protocol](#7-MapmyIndiaSafetyPluginDelegate-Protocol)

`MapmyIndiaSafetyPluginDelegate` is a protocol class which have
different methods which are called to indicated different states and
provide data accordingly.

It has different methods for Success, Failure, Request Started etc.

``` {.swift}
extension ViewController: MapmyIndiaSafetyPluginDelegate {
    func didRequestForContainmentInfo() {

    }

    func didUpdateContainmentInfo(results: ContainmentZoneInfo) {

    }

    func didFail(error: NSError) {

    }
```

In success callback which is `didUpdateContainmentInfo` delegate method
an object of type ContainmentZoneInfo is received which have different
properties as explained below:

-   isInsideContainmentZone (boolean) - True if user stays inside the
    containment zone else false.

-   containmentZoneName (String) - Name of the containment zone.

-   mapLink (String) - Map link for containment zone.

-   distanceToNearestZone (Long) - Distance to the nearest containment
    zone.

-   districtName (String) - Name of the district.

-   zoneType (String) - District Zone current type like red, orange and
    green zone.

In failure callback which is `didFail` delegate method error object is
received with different error codes as explained below:

-   400 - Bad Request

-   401 - Unauthorized

-   500- Internal Server Error

-   503 - Service Unavailable

-   In case of API return no Data then Api Message return should be Data
    Not found.

-   Internet Not available

-   Keys are not set by developer Please contact with the support team.

-   Please add location permissions or coreMotion keys in plist.
