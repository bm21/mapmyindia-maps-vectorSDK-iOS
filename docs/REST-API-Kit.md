## [Getting Started](#Getting-Started)

MapmyIndia Maps SDK for IOS lets you easily add MapmyIndia Maps and web services to your own iOS app. MapmyIndia Maps SDK for iOS supports iOS SDK 9.0 and above and Xcode 10.1 or later. You can have a look at the map and features you will get in your own app by using the MapmyIndia Maps app for iOS. The SDK handles map tiles download and their display along with a bunch of controls and native gestures.

## [API Usage and Requirements](#API-Usage-and-Requirements)
Your MapmyIndia Maps SDK usage needs a set of license keys ([get them here](http://www.mapmyindia.com/api/signup) ) and is governed by the API [terms and conditions](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/terms-&-conditions). 
As part of the terms and conditions, you cannot remove or hide the MapmyIndia logo and copyright information in your project. 
Please see [branding guidelines](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/advanced-maps/API-Branding-Guidelines.pdf) on MapmyIndia [website](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api) for more details.
The allowed SDK hits are described on the plans page. Note that your usage is
shared between platforms, so the API hits you make from a web application, Android app or an iOS app all add up to your allowed daily limit.

MapmyIndia's keys must be set to initialize SDKs. Which can  be set in two ways.

**First Way**
You can also set these required keys programmatically. Add the following to your application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method, replacing restAPIKey and mapSDKKey with your own API keys:

```swift
MapmyIndiaAccountManager.setMapSDKKey("MAP SDK_KEY")
MapmyIndiaAccountManager.setRestAPIKey("REST API_KEY")
MapmyIndiaAccountManager.setAtlasClientId("ATLAS CLIENT_ID")
MapmyIndiaAccountManager.setAtlasClientSecret("ATLAS CLIENT_SECRET")
MapmyIndiaAccountManager.setAtlasGrantType("GRANT_TYPE") //always put client_credentials
```

**Second Way**
By adding following keys in Info.plist file of your project MapmyIndiaSDKKey, MapmyIndiaRestKey, MapmyIndiaAtlasClientId, MapmyIndiaAtlasClientSecret, MapmyIndiaAtlasGrantType.


## [Autosuggest API](#Autosuggest-API)

For live demo click [LIVE DEMO](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/advanced-maps/doc/sample/mapmyindia-maps-auto-suggest-api-example.php)

Get "type as you go" suggestion while searching for a location.

The Autosuggest API helps users to complete queries faster by adding intelligent search capabilities to your web or mobile app. This API returns a list of results as well as suggested queries as the user types in the search field.

The Autosuggest helps users to complete queries faster by adding intelligent search capabilities to your iOS mobile app. It takes a human readable query such as place name, address or eLoc and returns a list of results.


Class used for Autosuggest search is `MapmyIndiaAutoSuggestManager`. Create a `MapmyIndiaAutoSuggestManager` object using your rest key or alternatively, you can place your rest key in the `MapmyIndiaRestKey` key of your application's Info.plist file, then use the shared instance of `MapmyIndiaAutoSuggestManager` class.

To perform auto suggest use `MapmyIndiaAutoSearchAtlasOptions` class to pass query parameter to get auto suggest search with an option to pass region in parameter `withRegion`, which is an enum of type `MMIRegionTypeIdentifier`. If no value is passed for region, It will take default value which is India.

`MMIRegionTypeIdentifier` is used to validate and get result for different countries. Currently five countries are supported including India which are Sri Lanka, India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal.

Additionally you can also set location and restriction filters in object of `MapmyIndiaAutoSearchAtlasOptions`. 

### Request Parameters

1.  **location:**  Location is required to get location bias autosuggest results.
2.  **zoom:**  takes the zoom level of the current scope of the map (min: 4, max: 18).
3.  **includeTokenizeAddress**: On setting value of this property to true it provides the different address attributes in a structured object in response.
4.  **pod**: It takes place type which helps in restricting the results to certain chosen type  
    Below mentioned are the codes for the pod -
    -   Sublocality
    -   Locality
    -   City
    -   Village
    -   Subdistrict
    -   District
    -   State
    -   Subsublocality
5.  **filter**: This helps you restrict the result either by mentioning a bounded area or to certain eLoc. Below mentioned are both types whose instance can be set to this parameter -
    -   (a) `MapmyIndiaElocFilter`: to filter results on basis of eLoc
    -   (b) `MapmyIndiaBoundsFilter`: to filter results on basis of geo bound.
6. **hyperLocal**: This parameter lets the search give results that are hyper-localized to the reference location passed in the location parameter. This means that nearby results are given a higher ranking than results far from the reference location. Highly prominent results will still appear in the search results, however they will be lower in the list of results. This parameter will work ONLY in conjunction with the location parameter.
### Response Parameters

In response of auto suggest search either you will receive an error or an array of `MapmyIndiaAtlasSuggestion`, Where `MapmyIndiaAtlasSuggestion` is derived from `MapmyIndiaSuggestion` class. Yo will find below useful properties in suggestion object :

1.  **type:**  type of location POI or Country or City
2.  **eLoc:**  Place Id of the location 6-char alphanumeric.
3.  **placeAddress:**  Address of the location.

## [Routing API](#Routing-API)

For live demo click [LIVE DEMO](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/advanced-maps/doc/sample/mapmyindia-maps-route-adv-api-example)

Get optimal & alternate routes between various locations with or without considering live traffic

Routing and displaying driving directions on map, including instructions for navigation, distance to destination, traffic etc. are few of the most important parts of developing a map based application. This REST API calculates driving routes between specified locations including via points based on route type(optimal or shortest) and includes delays for traffic congestion.



Use `Directions` to get route between locations. You can use it either by creating object using your rest key **or** use shared instance of `Directions` class by setting rest key in the `MapmyIndiaRestKey` key of your application’s `Info.plist` file.

To perform this operation use object of `RouteOptions` class as request to pass source location and destination locations and other parameters.

To use **Route with traffic based ETA** feature, to get duration inclusive of traffic for a distance between locations use parameter resourceIdentifier as described below:

- `resourceIdentifier`: This property should be set to `MBDirectionsResourceIdentifierRouteAdv`, `MBDirectionsResourceIdentifierRouteETA` or `MBDirectionsResourceIdentifierRouteTraffic`. The default value of this property is `MBDirectionsResourceIdentifierRouteETA`.

### Request Parameters

Additionally you can set some more parameters on instance of `RouteOptions` to get filtered/specific results. Which are as :

1. `routeType`: It is type of enum  `MapmyIndiaRouteType` which can accept values `quickest`, `shortest`, `none`. By default its value is `none`.
2. `region`: It is type of enum `MapmyIndiaRegionTypeIdentifier`. It is used to validate and get result for different countries. Currently five countries are supported including India which are Sri Lanka, India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal.

**Note**: If you are using **Routing with traffic** `routeType` and `region` values are not considered. Traffic is only available in India and only optimal route calculation is allowed with traffic.

### Steps to get directions

- To get directions create an array of `Waypoint` class, add two objects of `Waypoint` class to this array to get route path. For origin position also set heading of instance of `Waypoint` class.
- Next create an instance of `RouteOptions` class by passing waypoints created in previous step.
```swift
let options = RouteOptions(waypoints: [
            Waypoint(coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.551078, longitude: 77.268968), name: "MapmyIndia"),
            Waypoint(coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.565065, longitude: 77.234193), name: "Moolchand"),
        ])
```
- Use `Directions` singleton class from `Directions` framework to get available routes.
- You can plot polylines on map for available routes by using Map framework. 

### [Directions Using eLocs](#Directions-Using-eLocs)

An object of Waypoint can be created using coordinate as well as [eLoc](#https://www.mapmyindia.com/eloc/) (unique identifier of place).

```swift
Waypoint(coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 28.551078, longitude: 77.268968), name: "MapmyIndia")

or

Waypoint(eLoc: "MMI000", name: "MapmyIndia")
```

### Code Samples

#### Swift
```swift
Directions.shared.calculate(options) { (waypoints, routes, error) in
            guard error == nil else {
                print("Error calculating directions: \(error!)")
                return
            }
            
            if let route = routes?.first, let leg = route.legs.first {
                self.currentRouteLeg = leg
                print("Route via \(leg):")
                
                let distanceFormatter = LengthFormatter()
                let formattedDistance = distanceFormatter.string(fromMeters: route.distance)
                
                let travelTimeFormatter = DateComponentsFormatter()
                travelTimeFormatter.unitsStyle = .short
                let formattedTravelTime = travelTimeFormatter.string(from: route.expectedTravelTime)
                
                print("Distance: \(formattedDistance); ETA: \(formattedTravelTime!)")
                
                for step in leg.steps {
                    print("\(step.instructions)")
                    if step.distance > 0 {
                        let formattedDistance = distanceFormatter.string(fromMeters: step.distance)
                        print("— \(formattedDistance) —")
                    }
                }
                
                if route.coordinateCount > 0 {
                    // Convert the route’s coordinates into a polyline.
                    var routeCoordinates = route.coordinates!
                    let routeLine = MGLPolyline(coordinates: &routeCoordinates, count: route.coordinateCount)
                    
                    // Add the polyline to the map and fit the viewport to the polyline.
                    self.mapView.addAnnotation(routeLine)
                    self.mapView.setVisibleCoordinates(&routeCoordinates, count: route.coordinateCount, edgePadding: .zero, animated: true)

## [Routing API - Legacy](#Routing-API---Legacy)

For live demo click [LIVE DEMO](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/advanced-maps/doc/sample/mapmyindia-maps-route-rest-api-example)

Get optimal & alternate routes between various locations with or without considering live traffic

Routing and displaying driving directions on map, including instructions for navigation, distance to destination, traffic etc. are few of the most important parts of developing a map based application. This REST API calculates driving routes between specified locations including via points based on route type(fastest or shortest), includes delays for traffic congestion , and is capable of handling additional route parameters like: type of roads to avoid, travelling vehicle type etc.



Class used for routing is `MapmyIndiaRouteTripManager`. Create a `MapmyIndiaRouteTripManager` object using your rest key or alternatively, you can place your rest key in the `MapmyIndiaRestKey` key of your application's Info.plist file, then use the shared instance of `MapmyIndiaRouteTripManager` class.

To perform routing use `MapmyIndiaRouteTripOptions` class to pass start location and destination location parameters.

### Request Parameters


Additionally you can pass some other parameters to get some filtered/specific results. Which are as:  
All Parameters defined below are optional parameters and default values will be considered if not sent.

1.  **viaPoints:**  the optional list of via-points. The complete route will therefore be start . via points in provided order . destination Note: "Maximum of 16 via points can be added." Also, look at the pricing section to know about the pricing and deductions for the use of via points in the API.
2.  **routeType:**  It is type of enum `DistanceRouteType`.
3.  **vehicleType:**  It is type of enum `DistanceVehicleType`.
4.  **avoids:**  The parameter to avoid road types along the route with default value none. It is type of enum `DistanceAvoidsType`.
5.  **withAlternatives:**  (true or false) : Parameter to toggle alternative routes. If .true. is sent, alternative routes will be provided else not. By default, the value is false. So, if the parameter is not sent, no alternative routes will be provided.
6.  **withAdvices:**  Advices are turn by turn navigation guidance provided by MapmyIndia routing services (e.g. After 200m take the first exit from the roundabout). To get advices send value true else send false.

### Response Parameters

In response of Route search either you will receive an error or an object of MapmyIndiaTripResult. You will find below useful properties in placemarks object :

1. **status**
	- a. Success:
		-   i) 0 for OK (All else means some failure in routing)
	    -   b. Errors:
	        -   i) 1 for too few waypoints provided]
	        -   ii) 2 for system error, route calculation failed.
2. **trips:**  A collection of routes that contain an object with the following properties:
	- **duration**: Duration of the route in seconds.
	- **status:**  Status set by routing engine: 6 means OK, any other number represents specific routing error. (Number)
	- **length:** Length of the entire trip in meters.
	- **pts:**  string of WGS-84 longitude-latitude pairs that indicates the path that needs to be drawn on the map to indicate the computed route. Please see notes below.
	- **advices (object):**  An array of advice objects. An advice is the instruction for the end user that often appears at critical points along a route. Each advice object consists of:
		- **text:**  Description of the advice.
		- **iconId:**  The numeric id of the icon that represents current advice icon. For details refer to Appendix C.
		- **meters:**  Distance to the advice location from the start point.
		- **seconds:**  Time to reach to the advice location from the start point.
		- **exitNR:**  The exit number on roundabout exit, 0 if advice is not on roundabout manoeuvre.
		- **point:**  an object of latitude and longitude of the location of the advice.
			- **longitude:**  longitude of the advice position.
			- **latitude:**  latitude of the advice position
3. **alternatives:**  A collection of alternative routes if the alternatives parameter is provided and is set to true else null is returned.

**Note:**
-   In case Via-Points are provided, no alternative routes will be returned.
-   If Via Points are provided then each via point is considered as a single trip hence you.ll receive a collection of trips object with 1 item if no via point is added and more if via points are added.
-   The Data type of `alternatives` is the same as that of the trip object
-   pts string needs to decode and convert into array of coordinates to be used on application side. A library to achieve this can be found here. Where precision 1e6 should be passed to decode.
