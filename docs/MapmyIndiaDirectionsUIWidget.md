## [Usage](#Usage)

The MapmyIndiaDirectionsUI makes it easy to integrate
MapmyIndiaDirections SDK to your iOS application. It gives you all the
tools you need to add Directions related UI components to your
application.

### [MapmyIndiaDirectionsViewController](#MapmyIndiaDirectionsViewController)

`MapmyIndiaDirectionsViewController` is type of UIViewController which
you can use to show screen for getting input from user to choose origin
and destination and show routes after that.

``` {.swift}
let directionVC = MapmyIndiaDirectionsViewController(for: [MapmyIndiaDirectionsLocation]())
self.navigationController?.pushViewController(directionVC, animated: false)
```

As from above code you can see it requires an array of object type
`MapmyIndiaDirectionsLocation`. It can be an blank array to launch
screen without any chosen locations.

Also you can pass fixed locations and launch instnace of
`MapmyIndiaDirectionsViewController`, as shown in below code:

``` {.swift}
var locationModels = [MapmyIndiaDirectionsLocation]()
let source = MapmyIndiaDirectionsLocation(location: "77.2639,28.5354", displayName: "Govindpuri", displayAddress: "", locationType: .suggestion)
        
let viaPoint = MapmyIndiaDirectionsLocation(location: "12269L", displayName: "Sitamarhi", displayAddress: "", locationType: .suggestion)
        
let destination = MapmyIndiaDirectionsLocation(location: "1T182A", displayName: "Majorganj", displayAddress: "", locationType: .suggestion)
        
self.locationModels.append(source)
self.locationModels.append(viaPoint)
self.locationModels.append(destination)
let directionVC = MapmyIndiaDirectionsViewController(for: self.locationModels)
directionVC.profileIdentifier = .driving
directionVC.attributationOptions = [.congestionLevel]
directionVC.resourceIdentifier = .routeETA
self.navigationController?.pushViewController(directionVC, animated: false)
```

#### [Configuration](#Configuration)

Here are the properties use to configure
`MapmyIndiaDirectionsViewController` route.

##### [Profile Identifier](Profile-Identifier)

It is instance of enum DirectionsProfileIdentifier which can accepts
values driving, walking, biking, trucking. By default its value is
driving.

##### [Resource Identifier](Resource-Identifier)

It is instance of enum DirectionsResourceIdentifier which can accepts
values routeAdv, routeETA. By default its value is routeAdv.

Note: To use RouteETA ‘resourceIdentifier’ should be routeETA and
‘profileIdentifier’ should be driving. In response of RouteETA a unique
identifier to that request will be received which can be get using
parameter routeIdentifier of object Route.

##### [AttributeOptions](AttributeOptions){.uri}

AttributeOptions for the route. Any combination of `AttributeOptions`
can be specified. By default, no attribute options are specified.

##### [IncludesAlternativeRoutes](IncludesAlternativeRoutes){.uri}

A Boolean value indicating whether alternative routes should be included
in the response. The default value of this property is `true`.

##### [autocompleteViewController](autocompleteViewController){.uri}

MapmyIndiaAutocompleteViewController provides an interface that displays
a table of autocomplete predictions that updates as the user enters
text. Place selections made by the user are returned to the app via the
`MapmyIndiaAutocompleteViewControllerResultsDelegate`.

##### [autocompleteAttributionSetting](autocompleteAttributionSetting){.uri}

AutocompleteAttributionSetting allow to change the appearance of the
logo in `MapmyIndiaAutocompleteViewController`

##### [autocompleteFilter](autocompleteFilter){.uri}

This property represents a set of restrictions that may be applied to
autocomplete requests. This allows customization of autocomplete
suggestions to only those places that are of interest.

##### [routeShapeResolution](routeShapeResolution){.uri}

A `routeShapeResolution` indicates the level of detail in a route’s
shape, or whether the shape is present at all its default value is
`.full`

##### [includesSteps](includesSteps){.uri}

A Boolean value indicating whether `MBRouteStep` objects should be
included in the response. its default value is `true`.

##### [isShowStartNavigation](isShowStartNavigation){.uri}

To show the Start Navigation button if the origin is current location.\
\

`MapmyIndiaDirectionsViewController` is created using several UI
components whose appearance can be changed according to user
requirements. Some of them are listed as below:

-   `MapmyIndiaDirectionsTopBannerView`
-   `MapmyIndiaDirectionsBottomBannerView`

### [MapmyIndiaDirectionsViewControllerDelegates](#MapmyIndiaDirectionsViewControllerDelegates)

It is a protocol class which will be used for callback methods as shown
below:

### Call Back Handler

``` {.swift}
/// This meathod will be called when back button is clicked in `TopBannerView`
1. didRequestForGoBack(for view: MapmyIndiaDirectionsTopBannerView)
```

``` {.swift}
/// The meathod will be called when  add viapoint button will clicked in `TopBannerView`.
2. didRequestForAddViapoint(_ sender: UIButton,for isEditMode: Bool)
```

``` {.swift}
/// The meathod will be called when  Directions button will clicked in `BottomBannerView`.
3. didRequestDirections()
```

``` {.swift}
//The meathod will be called when  start button will clicked in `BottomBannerView`.
4. didRequestForStartNavigation(for routes: [Route], locations: [MapmyIndiaDirectionsLocation], selectedRouteIndex: Int, error: NSError)
```

### [MapmyIndiaDirectionsTopBannerView](#MapmyIndiaDirectionsTopBannerView)

`MapmyIndiaDirectionsTopBannerView` is type of UIView which show the
source, destination and viapoint locations at the top of
`MapmyIndiaDirectionsViewController`

This class accepts array of `MapmyIndiaDirectionsLocation` from which it
set value of source, destination and viapoint.

### [MapmyIndiaDirectionsBottomBannerView](#MapmyIndiaDirectionsBottomBannerView)

`MapmyIndiaDirectionsBottomBannerView` is class of type UIView, it used
for showing the route information i.e ArivalTime, DistanceRemening,
TimeRemening.

To use this class it takes we need to call a function
`updateBottomBanner` which accepts three parameters i.e route,
selectedRoute, locationModel.

-   **route:** It is an array of the Routes which is required to update
    bottom banner view.
-   **selectedRoute:** If you have multiple routes then it will give the
    selected route in `Integer`
-   **locationModel:** LocationModel is an array of the type
