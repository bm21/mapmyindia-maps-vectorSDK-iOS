# Guide - Show COVID-19 Safety Status on MapmyIndia's Map

## [Introduction](#Introduction)

It is a guide to display a user's safety status for COVID-19 on a map.
It will show whether user is in a containment zone or not if yes how
much is distance from current location.

Following this guide it will be possible to display user's safety status
on MapmyIndia's Map^[\[1\]](#%5B1%5D)^ in the form of a safety strip
depending upon the user's current location. [MapmyIndiaMaps SDK for
iOS](https://github.com/MapmyIndia/mapmyindia-maps-vectorSDK-iOS/wiki)
is SDK to display map on iOS platform.

A method need to be called to check safety status. SDK has inbuild view
with button which can be used to call that method.

A sample application project can be found on github by following link:
[iOS
MapDemo](https://github.com/MapmyIndia/mapmyindia-maps-vectorSDK-iOS).

**Note** This fetatue is available from version `5.7.8` of
MapmyIndiaMaps SDK.

## [Getting Started](#Getting-Started)

### [Get Safety Status](#Get-Safety-Status)

After loading of MapmyIndia's Map^[\[1\]](#%5B1%5D)^, a mthod can be
called to get safety status. `showCurrentLocationSafety` is the method
which helps to find user's safety status. On successfully fetching of
status a safety strip will be shown on map.

##### Objective-C

<div class="sourceCode">

``` {.sourceCode .objectivec}
[_mapView showCurrentLocationSafety];
```

</div>

##### Swift

``` {.swift}
mapView.showCurrentLocationSafety()
```

> **Note:** `showCurrentLocationSafety` will only works if user's
> location is available. So best practice to call this function when map
> is ready to show user's location. A delegate method
> `didUpdateUserLocation` of map SDK can be used to check when map is
> ready to show user location.

### [Safety Strip](#Safety-Strip)

On successfully receiving status based on location from server, a view
will be shown on map with safety information like distance, containment
zone location etc. By default its position will be on top of map.

#### [Safety Strip Position](#Safety-Strip-Position)

By default safety status strip will be shown on top of map. But its
position can be changed by property `safetyStripPosition` which is of
type `MGLOrnamentPosition`.

##### Objective-C

<div class="sourceCode">

``` {.sourceCode .objectivec}
[_mapView setSafetyStripPosition:MGLOrnamentPositionBottomLeft];
```

</div>

##### Swift

``` {.swift}
mapView.safetyStripPosition = .bottomLeft
```

#### [Safety Strip Margins](#Safety-Strip-Margins)

By default margins of safety status is zero. But margins can be set by
property `safetyStripMargins` which is of type `CGPoint`.

##### Objective-C

<div class="sourceCode">

``` {.sourceCode .objectivec}
[_mapView setSafetyStripMargins:CGPointMake(0, 30)];
```

</div>

##### Swift

``` {.swift}
mapView.safetyStripMargins = CGPoint(x: 0, y: 30)
```

### [Hide Safety Status](#Hide-Safety-Status)

Safety Strip can be hidden from map by calling method `hideSafetyStrip`.

##### Objective-C

<div class="sourceCode">

``` {.sourceCode .objectivec}
[_mapView hideSafetyStrip];
```

</div>

##### Swift

``` {.swift}
mapView.hideSafetyStrip()
```
